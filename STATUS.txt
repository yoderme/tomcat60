* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing

  the host and not on an alias.

   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
