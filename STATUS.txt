                         Apache Tomcat 6.0 Patch Proposals
                         =================================


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

None


PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57644
  Update examples to use Apache Standard Taglibs 1.2.3
  http://svn.apache.org/r1662736

    1) When running with Security Manager enabled, it fails at
       /examples/jsp/jsp2/tagfiles/products.jsp
       and many subsequent pages with
        java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission org.apache.taglibs.standard.xml.accessExternalEntity read)
  
       followed by java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError which result in compilation failure.

       Without Security Manager it runs OK.

    2) Do not forget to update webapps/docs/changelog.xml

    3) OK with scan exclusion lists.
       Unlike Tomcat 7 and later there is no need to update them.

       (Tomcat 6 does not perform annotation scanning, so exclusion does
       not save much time. TLD exclusion lists are hard-coded in java code
       (e.g. search for "ecj-4.3.1.jar"), and do not skip jstl.jar.)


* Fix https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=56608
  Watched resources should be tracked if they are expected to exist even if they
  don't exist when the Context starts
  Also prevent multiple changes at the same time triggering multiple reloads
  rather than just one

PATCHES/ISSUES THAT ARE STALLED:

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44312
  Log an error if there is a conflict between Host and Alias names.
  Improve host management methods in Mapper to avoid occasionally removing
  a wrong host. Check that host management operations are performed on
  the host and not on an alias.
  1) https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=31744
  2) http://svn.apache.org/r1608653
  3) http://svn.apache.org/r1608833
  4) TestMapper changes from http://svn.apache.org/r1608831
  +1: kkolinko, remm, schultz
  -1:
   kkolinko: Good for occasional review, but as backporting r1608833 won't
   be trivial I'd have to update the patch.
   schultz: r1608833 is good, but it does not look like it is absolutely
   required to fix BZ 44312.
